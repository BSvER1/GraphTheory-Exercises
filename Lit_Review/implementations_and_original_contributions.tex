\chapter{Implementations \& Original Contributions}

\section{Introduction}
This section outlines specific implementations of some of the algorithms described above. Where possible pseudocode is provided. In most cases it is \emph{not} the complete algorithm and further analysis of the original paper will be required to reconstruct the algorithm. Results for comparison of the algorithms is given in the Results section.
