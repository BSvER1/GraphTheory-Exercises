\section{Flower Pollination}
\subsection{Implementation and Problems}

Ok so I have to say that I think that this paper\cite{7175923} SUCKS. I was drawn to it initially because it was a new (2015) optimisation algorithm and we wanted something to compare to the gravitational swarm intelligence\cite{bib:GravSwarm}, plus it was flowers which is kinda cute.\\
Anyway, the first warning sign should have been that it's from Algeria, but that would have been racist. Second warning sign: THEY WORD FOR WORD COPIED from Yang's paper. Like, full blown plagiarism. Damn, how does that pass peer review??? Of course, I hadn't actually read Yang's paper at the start so I didn't know that.. Third warning sign: The algorithm doesn't quite match up with the pollination properties it supposedly takes inspiration from. Ok, not just these guys fault, Yang does the same thing.\\
So I tried to implement it. And I failed. Some parts of the pseudocode I just didn't know what they were talking about, and when I managed to work around that to hobble something together that ran, it just didn't do anything. So I hacked and hacked and made something that started to work! But it was still rubbish.\\

The original algorithm is as follows




Since it was rubbish, I made some changes which I will describe in the next section.
